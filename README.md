Resume
======

A simple script to create a pdf version of my resume from markdown and css.

The repo is based on repo '[johncadengo/Resume](https://github.com/johncadengo/Resume).' 

I have made several changes to the original design: 
- create a modified css file to get a slightly different layout
- add a jupyter notebook file so that the user can use notebook to generate their resume
- change the pdf creator to 'weasyprint' which does not depend on other packages. Thus, the requirements.txt file has changed. 

A good reference document on editing the markdown file: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
